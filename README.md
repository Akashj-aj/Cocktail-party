# Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement System for Deaf Users in Multi-Speaker Environments

> Isolating and clarifying speech in multi-speaker environments — through the fusion of sound and sight.

---

## Overview

Understanding speech when multiple people talk at once is one of the hardest perceptual challenges — even for those with full hearing. In noisy, multi-speaker settings like meetings, classrooms, and social gatherings, picking out a single voice from the mix is a problem that remains unsolved at scale.

This system addresses that problem by combining audio and video signals to isolate a target speaker's voice, suppress overlapping speech and noise, and deliver cleaner, intelligible output in real time.

---

## How It Works

The system operates in three stages:

**1. Input Capture**  
A microphone captures the raw audio stream while a camera records the target speaker's face — specifically lip movements and facial dynamics.

**2. Audio-Visual Fusion**  
Visual features extracted from lip motion are fused with audio features to build a joint representation of the target speaker. This multimodal signal serves as a strong anchor when separating the speaker from a noisy, multi-speaker mixture.

**3. Output Delivery**  
- Users receive an enhanced, noise-suppressed audio stream  
- Optional real-time transcription and visual feedback output

## Key Features

- Real-time multi-speaker separation using audio-visual cues  
- Lip-reading-informed speech enhancement  
- Dual output modes — enhanced audio and text/visual  
- Designed for challenging real-world settings: meetings, classrooms, social gatherings

## Getting Started

> Setup instructions will be added as the project develops.

```bash
# Clone the repository
https://github.com/Akashj-aj/Cocktail-party.git
cd Cocktail-party

# Install dependencies
# (instructions coming soon)
```

---

## Project Status

This project is currently in early development. Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are welcome.

---

## Motivation

The cocktail party problem — isolating a single speaker from a noisy mix of voices — is one of the longest-standing challenges in signal processing and AI. Recent advances in deep learning and multimodal fusion have opened new paths to solving it. This project explores those paths by combining visual speech cues with audio processing to build a system that works in the real world, not just in lab conditions.
